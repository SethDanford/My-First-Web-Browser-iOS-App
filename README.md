# My First Web Browser
## What is it?
It is a very simple web browser.
## How does it work?
First, the user is presented with a list of websites to load initially. Once the user chooses
one of the options in the list, they will be presented with the main screen.
On the top left and right of the screen in the navigation bar the user will see "Back" and 
"Forward" buttons. These are used to navigate back to the last page you were one or forward
to the last page you were on (if that makes any sense). In the centre of the top navigation
bar is where the name of the website will be displayed. The website will take up most of the
screen in the centre of the display.
