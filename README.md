# My First Web Browser
## What is it?
It is a very simple iOS web browser app.
## How does it work?
First, the user is presented with a list of websites to load initially. Once the user chooses
one of the options in the list, they will be presented with the main screen.

On the top left and right of the screen in the navigation bar the user will see "Back" and 
"Forward" buttons. These are used to navigate back to the last page the user was on or forward
to the last page the user was on (if that makes any sense). In the centre of the top navigation
bar is where the name of the website will be displayed. 

The website will take up most of the screen in the centre of the display.

On the bottom centre of the screen there is an "Open" button which will open a menu of 
websites that the user can choose from. In the bottom left of the screen there is a 
progress bar that shows the loading progress of the web page. In the bottom right of the
screen there is a reload button that reloads the current page.
